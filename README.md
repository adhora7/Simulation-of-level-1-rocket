## Rocket Simulation using OpenRocket

For this project, I used **OpenRocket**, an open-source software for **model rocket simulation**, to simulate a **Level 1 Rocket**. OpenRocket allows for the modeling and simulation of rocket flights, including the aerodynamics, propulsion, and recovery system. The tool provides detailed analysis of the rocket's trajectory, altitude, and flight behavior under different conditions. 

I utilized OpenRocket's capabilities to simulate the flight dynamics of my Level 1 rocket design, testing various configurations to optimize performance
